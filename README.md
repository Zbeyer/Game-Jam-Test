# Game-Jam-Test



# Test your setup!

Make sure everything is set up correctly and that you can build a small test project in your chosen game engine. This will save you a lot of time and frustration during the jam. My recommendation is to make a small project :

- A box that moves with the arrow keys
- A box that changes color when you click on it
- A box that plays a sound when you click on it
- A background image
- A box using an animated sprite
Have the source posted on an external version control system (like GitHub)
